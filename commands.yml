ansible-config view #shows which config is currently active and its details
ansible-config dump #shows local as well as global configs -- what ever is in yellow/orange is custom set by us in the configs
ansible-config list #shows explanation for the values that was gotten using the dump option

ansible all -m ping #Uses "all" module and connects to all the hosts. Ungrouped is another group of hosts which includes all those that done
                    #belong to any other group in the inventory -- for a ping returns pong -- to validate if you are able to connect to inventory

ansible python:slack -m ping
ansible 'dev:!slack' -m ping #Eclude slack host
ansible all -m ping -f 1 #Runs on one host at a time and not in parallel
ansible-playbook slack.yml --limit #this option can be used to limit playbook exec to a certain hosts or groups. When you use limit,
        #the module (all, * etc) should have matching hosts. else it fails. limit only works on alreday successfully retrieved results.
        #If there is not result from the module then --limit throws error

ansible-console -b #repl editor logs into the host and enables us to run modules directly. It creates the connetion  to all the hosts when we run the module.

ansible-playbook systems.yml --syntax-check; echo $? #Checks the syntax of the playbook, make sure $?=0, generally the error would be in the previous line.
ansible-playbook slack.yml --list-hosts | --list-tasks #where would the playbook apply the tasks. you can add tags at tasks level
ansible-playbook slack.yml --check # check does dry run
ansible-playbook slack.yml --step #Allows step by step execution of tasks
ansible-playbook slack.yml --start-at-task="<task name>"

ansible-playbook slack.yml --syntax-check


#Running some Raw commands on a host -- winRm in case of windows, ssh incase of linux
ansible all -f 1 -a "free" # -a option just runs raw commands
ansible all -f 1 -a -b "free" # -b option is become option, allows to sudo
ansible-doc --list|wc -l #lists the number of modules
ansible-doc --list |grep slack #shows specific module

#Using modules
ansible app -m yum -s -a "name=ntp state=installed" #-m yum --> module name,state --> kv pair arguments
                                                    #These modules can be put inside a play book and it gives a json output.
ansible-doc -s yum #shows the details about the user yum module. Add -s option to get short description

ansible slack -m command -a "free|grep -i swap" #allows you to run commands but wont allow extra properties on output. So, we use shell as below- evernote
ansible slack -m shell -a "free|grep -i swap"
ansible slack -vvvv -m raw -a "whoami"  #does direct ssh, python module subsystem is not used. THIS DOES NOT NEED PYTHON ON THE RESULTNG NODE.
ansible slack -vvvv -m command -a "whoami" #uses command module

gather_facts: no #Disabls gathering facts and speeds up the process. use this only if you dont use facts or variables
with_items #iterator for installing multiple items. - chap7, roles/php/tasks/main.yml
inventory_hostname # contains the name of the current node being worked on…. (as in, what it is defined in your hosts file as) so if you want to skip a task for a single node
stdout_lines #contains the output with new line char.
stdout # contains the output in string format

######################################
Roles
######################################
roles/apache/tasks/service.yml # Contains the actuall installation Commands
roles/apache/tasks/install.yml # Contains what we do with severice -- like start or stop.
roles/apache/tasks/config.yml #Contains the logic for copying files and operations specific to the insalled service.
roles/apache/handlers/main.yml #will have the notification based tasks , that comes from config.yml. The exact "name" given here would be used in config.xml to notify
                              #If there is notify anywhere, look into the handlers folder to see what it is notifying for.
roles/apache/files #Will contain all the files that we want to copy over to the hosts - like krb5.conf. You need to copy that file into this folder to propagate.
roles/apache/tasks/main.yml #contains import_tasks
roles/apache/meta/main.yml #Contains dependencies, dont have to list the tasks separately in the main playbook using import. Its good to set dependencies for common tasks.

#Nested Roles -- Good practice to create system role for all the common tasks
#system.yml will be on the home directory. system role will be created as a noraml role, but its dependency will be added to specific role.


######################################
Variables
######################################
#Different version of the applicaiton to different hosts is possible with vars

#chap 8 for templates; specific values in default dir and the j2 file in templates folder
hash_behaviour: merge  ---#ansible.conf file
group_vars folder #define variables for a group of servers chap8

#register variables. Can use when clause and perform actions based on the results
register: results
- name: print registered
  debug: var=result #prints the output
